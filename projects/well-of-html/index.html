            <p>When I was a little kid, I thought all of my stuffed animals were <b>sentient</b>,
            so I would sleep with a different one every night so as not to play favorites. It was quite stressful.</p>

            <p><strong>Affective Forecasting</strong> is the act of predicting how one will feel in the future.
            Humans are very bad at it, because our present feelings cloud our ability to see how we may make future 
            decisions.</p>

            <p>Here is a very good poem, <em><b>Vulture</b></em>, by <i>Robinson Jeffers</i>:
            I had walked since dawn and lay down to rest on a bare hillside
            Above the ocean. I saw through half-shut eyelids a vulture wheeling
            high up in heaven,
            And presently it passed again, but lower and nearer, its orbit
            narrowing,
            I understood then
            That I was under inspection. I lay death-still and heard the flight-
            feathers
            Whistle above me and make their circle and come nearer.
            I could see the naked red head between the great wings
            Bear downward staring. I said, 'My dear bird, we are wasting time
            here.
            These old bones will still work; they are not for you.' But how
            beautiful
            he looked, gliding down
            On those great sails; how beautiful he looked, veering away in the
            sea-light
            over the precipice. I tell you solemnly
            That I was sorry to have disappointed him. To be eaten by that beak
            and
            become part of him, to share those wings and those eyes--
            What a sublime end of one's body, what an enskyment; what a life
            after death.
